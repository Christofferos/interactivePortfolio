          <p>
            Several businesses in my local area do not have websites that make their brand more accessible for possible
            customers. That's why I started reaching out to several of them in order to gain valuable experience in the
            freelancing environment.

          <h6>League of Legends Coach</h6>
          <p>
            From my 9 years of playing the e-sport game League of Legends, I learned a thing or two. I achieved the
            highest rank in both of the competitive game modes and later moved on to competitive online tournaments for
            one year. Then I found the website Gamer Sensei, where users could pay you money to be coached - it felt
            like the perfect next step.

          <p>
            During my year of working at McDonalds Farsta Centrum, I learned to work well under pressure, the importance
            of distributing work load within a team and to prioritizing tasks when time is of the essence! I also,
            realized that it was possible to have a great time with colleagues, even though we were faced with a
            constant barrage of new customers all the time.
