            Several businesses in my local area do not have websites that make their brand more accessible for possible

            freelancing environment.

            From my 9 years of playing the e-sport game League of Legends, I learned a thing or two. I achieved the
            highest rank in both of the competitive game modes and later moved on to competitive online tournaments for
            one year. Then I found the website Gamer Sensei, where users could pay you money to be coached - it felt
            like the perfect next step.

            realized that it was possible to have a great time with colleagues, even though we were faced with a
